# Question

What are environment variables? How do you access them in Node?

# Answer

Environment variables are hidden variables that are stored on the host's machine and they can be used to store sensitive information such as the API Key.

Environment variables are accessible in Node through the `process.env` object. For example, the API KEY can be stored as `process.env.API_KEY`
