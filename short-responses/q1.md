# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer

The danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend is that it makes the API Key public, which allows other people to use the same API Key. The API Key are personalized that allows an individual or company to use the services. If a malicious actor knows about the API Key, they essentially have access to your account and can use it on your behalf.

By making the API request in the backend on the server, the API Key is kept in the server, making it private and hidden from users. This provides security as only the server will know and use the API Key.
